# Sandbox2

Sandbox2 is a C++ security sandbox for Linux which can be used to run untrusted
programs or portions of programs in confined environments. The idea is that the
runtime environment is so restricted that security bugs such as buffer overflows
in the protected region cause no harm.

## Who is it for?

Sandbox2 is aimed to sandbox C/C++ code or whole binaries in production.

See the sandboxing options [overview page](../docs/sandbox-overview.md) to make
sure this is the type of sandboxing you are looking for.

## How does it work?

technology.
