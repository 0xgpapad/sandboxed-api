# OpenJPEG

This library provides sandboxed version of the [OpenJPEG](https://github.com/uclouvain/openjpeg) library. 

## Examples

The examples are sandboxed and simplified version of the main tools provided by the OpenJPEG library, namely (for now) `opj_decompress` from [here](https://github.com/uclouvain/openjpeg/blob/master/src/bin/jp2/opj_decompress.c).
